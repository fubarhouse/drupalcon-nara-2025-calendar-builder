## Data Source

Session data is sourced from the [official DrupalCon Nara 2025 schedule](https://events.drupal.org/nara2025/schedule) and stored in `data/events.json`. This json file was generated by a small Python script using the "Program" page at the DrupalCon website as data source. The conversion was made on Monday October 7.
